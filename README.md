# Issue Tracking System

This is a final project of 6083 Database Course (frontend: React, bootstrap; backend: PHP slim; database: MySQL)   

Design and implement a web-based issue tracking system similar to Jira. It allows members to create projects, report issues/bugs for projects, assign the issue to certain people for fixing, and change the status of issues in the workflow. 
- User can sign up for the system by providing an email, username, display name, and password. Users can create projects. 
- Project has a suitable name, a short description, a few project leads and several tasks.
- Issue is a kind of task. Each issue has its title and description, and belongs to a certain project. 
- Once an issue is reported, it goes through several steps to be processed. The life cycle of an issue is called “workflow”. 
- Workflow is indicated by status, such as OPEN, REVIEW, TEST, CLOSE, etc.
